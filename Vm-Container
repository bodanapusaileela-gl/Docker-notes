                                                           Key Differences Between Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers
VMs: Run on a hypervisor, each VM includes a full guest OS.
Containers: Share the host OS kernel, no guest OS needed.
VMs: Higher resource use due to full OS overhead.
Containers: Lightweight, lower resource use.
VMs: Slower to start due to OS initialization.
Containers: Faster to start.
VMs: Strong isolation, suitable for diverse OS environments.
Containers: Less isolation, process-level.
Use Cases:
VMs: Ideal for running varied OS environments and legacy applications.
Containers: Best for microservices, DevOps, and scalable applications.
Performance:
VMs: Slightly reduced performance due to virtualization overhead.
Containers: High performance due to minimal overhead.
Portability:
VMs: Less portable due to full OS dependency.
Containers: Highly portable across different environments.
